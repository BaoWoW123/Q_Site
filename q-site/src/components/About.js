        Welcome to your journey. At Q’s Counseling, healing is seen as a
        personal and powerful process; one that honors where you’ve been while
        gently guiding you toward where you’re going. Like the lotus rising from
        the mud, your journey may begin in uncertainty, but it holds the power
        to bloom into something whole, resilient, and deeply yours.

        Q’s Counseling was created to hold space for your meaningful journey
        through adversity, with empathy and grace, not judgement. Whether you're
        navigating life transitions, healing through pain, or simply seeking to
        feel more like yourself again, this is a space to be seen, supported,
        and gently guided back to your center.
