            I am a Licensed Clinical Mental Health Counselor Associate (LCMHCA)
            with over 3 years of experience in the state of North Carolina. I
            strive to provide a safe, understanding, and nonjudgmental space for
            people from all walks of life, particularly women, women veterans,
            adolescents, and those going through life transitions.

            As a veteran, first-generation Asian-American immigrant, and a
            mother, I understand the stigma surrounding mental health and the
            weight and pressure that many of us carry. These lived experiences
            have shaped my passion for creating a safe, affirming, and
            collaborative space where those struggling with quiet battles can
            feel seen, heard, and supported.

            My counseling style is warm and collaborative; drawing from
            person-centered therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and
            mindfulness. But more than techniques, I believe in meeting you
            exactly where you are. Whether youâ€™re navigating anxiety,
            depression, trauma, ADHD, or just longing to feel more like yourself
            again and/or tell your story, I am here to support you. This is your
            space - to breathe, to be, to begin again.
