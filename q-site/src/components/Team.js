        <p>
           I am a Licensed Clinical Mental Health Counselor Associate
          (LCMHCA) with over 3 years of experience in the state of North
          Carolina. I strive to provide a safe, understanding, and nonjudgmental
          space for people from all walks of life, particularly women, women
          veterans, adolescents, and those going through life transitions.
        </p>

          As a veteran, first-generation Asian-American immigrant, and a mother,
          I understand the stigma surrounding mental health and the weight and
          pressure that many of us carry. These lived experiences have shaped my
          passion for creating a safe, affirming, and collaborative space where
          those struggling with quiet battles can feel seen, heard, and
          supported.
        </p>
        My counseling style is warm and collaborative; drawing from
        person-centered therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and
        mindfulness. But more than techniques, I believe in meeting you exactly
        where you are. Whether youâ€™re navigating anxiety, depression, trauma,
        ADHD, or just longing to feel more like yourself again and/or tell your
        story, I am here to support you. This is your space - to breathe, to be,
        to begin again.
