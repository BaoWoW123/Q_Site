              I am a Licensed Clinical Mental Health Counselor Associate
              (LCMHCA) with over 2 years of experience in the state of North
              Carolina. I strive to provide a safe, understanding, and
              nonjudgmental space for people from all walks of life,
              particularly veterans, women, women veterans, adolescents, young
              adults, and those going through life transitions.

              As a veteran, first-generation
              Asian-American immigrant, and a mother, I understand the stigma
              surrounding mental health and the weight and pressure that many of
              us carry. These lived experiences have shaped my passion for
              creating a safe, affirming, and collaborative space where those
              struggling with quiet battles can feel seen, heard, and supported.

              My counseling style is warm and collaborative; drawing from
              person-centered therapy, motivational interview, Cognitive
              Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)
              skills. But more than techniques, I believe in meeting you exactly
              where you are. Whether youâ€™re navigating anxiety, depression,
              trauma, ADHD, or just longing to feel more like yourself again
              and/or tell your story, I am here to support you. This is your
              space - to breathe, to be, to begin again.
